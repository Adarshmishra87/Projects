        <h2>THE AKATSUKI</h2>
        <span>is now, assembled.</span>
        <p>
          Akatsuki (暁, literally meaning: "Dawn" or "Daybreak") was a group of
          shinobi that existed outside the usual system of hidden villages. Over
          the course of several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and was
          led by different individuals.

          <h2>THE AKATSUKI</h2>
          <h3>Organization</h3>
          <p>
            Akatsuki's desire for an end to war attracted many fellow Ame ninja
            to their cause and, in time, word of their exploits began to travel
            beyond Amegakure's borders. Akatsuki's early fame was owed largely
            to Yahiko's leadership and his natural charisma, which kept the
            group united and motivated them to persevere despite the
            difficulties of their goal. Yahiko, however, viewed himself as
            merely a facilitator for Nagato, who would ultimately be the actual
            source of world peace because of his Rinnegan.

          <h3>Nagato Uzumaki</h3>
          <p>
            Nagato (長門) was a shinobi of Amegakure and descendant of the
            Uzumaki clan. Forming Akatsuki alongside his friends (and fellow war
            orphans) Yahiko and Konan, Nagato dreamed of bringing peace to the
            violent shinobi world. However, following Yahiko's death, Nagato
            adopted the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan,
            began leading a new Akatsuki — one that would force the world into
            peace using any means necessary.

          <h3>Konan</h3>
          <p>
            Konan (小南) was a kunoichi from Amegakure and a founding member of
            the original Akatsuki. After Yahiko's death, she was partnered with
            Nagato, who had since taken control of Akatsuki, and was the only
            member to call him by his name. After Nagato's death, Konan defected
            from Akatsuki and became the de facto village head of Amegakure.

          <h3>Itachi Uchiha</h3>
          <p>
            Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of
            Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later
            became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan,
            sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the
            international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose
            activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its
            ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing
            Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be
            more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only
            ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a
            loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
